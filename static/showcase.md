---
## What do we rely on?

Main sources
- Sentinel 2
- Sentinel 3
- Marine Services

---
## What do we offer?

Our goal is to provide updated indications about quality of the water exploiting different information we get from satellites.


---
## How we do it?

We collect different parameters from our sources, e.g.
- Water colour
- Turbidity
- Wave speed / direction
- Temperature
- Algae concentration
- Suspended Matter


---
## How we do it?

We analyze the data with reliable programs for satellite images and mathematical formulas are applied to produce a quality index, named Q-Sea index. 

---
## How we do it?

We build maps which will show indications about quality of the water. This gives anyone the opportunity to know about conditions and take own decisions regarding the best spot to go.
